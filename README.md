In the scripts folder, just run each R script after installing all the required R packages to obtain each result figure.

Each result figure will appear in Results/Revised_Figures/Revised_Figure_(v2)_i.pdf , where i represents figure number.

Text results are provided in Results/Revised_Text_Results/ folder. Similarly, figures are provided in Results/Revised_Figures/ folder.

The data used for all the experiments is also available at: Mall, Raghvendra (2020), “Transcriptomic Dataset for Network based identification of key Master Regulators for Immunologic Constant of Rejection”, Mendeley Data, V1, doi: 10.17632/d9ffb7kkzt.3

#Data should be downloaded and used as 'Data' folder within main ICR_Analysis repository for running R scripts.

In the Data/Others/ folder, please gunzip the me_net_full.Rdata.gz file
