Text results are provided in Results/Text_Results/ folder. Similarly, figures are provided in Results/Figures/ folder.

The data used for all the experiments are available at: Mall, Raghvendra (2020), “Transcriptomic Dataset for Network based identification of key Master Regulators for Immunologic Constant of Rejection”, Mendeley Data, V1, doi: 10.17632/d9ffb7kkzt.3

Data should be downloaded and used as 'Data' folder within main ICR_Analysis repository for running R scripts.

In the Data/Others/ folder, please gunzip the me_net_full.Rdata.gz file

Similarly, in the Results/<cancer>/Adjacency_Matrix/ folder for each cancer, please gunzip the <cancer>_Full_Final_Adjacency_Matrix.csv.gz
